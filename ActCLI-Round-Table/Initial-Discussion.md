Once we get our facilitated conversation between AIs going and reflected in the viewer, I want to put up a public demo page, sort of reality show - that would:
  - run our AI discussions on schedule, say once or twice a day
  - take from viewers discussion topics in advance, have them in queue
  - auto-filter bad ones
  - let viewers vote on priority of good ones
  - run round tables and record sessions
  - have a vieweable archive of past sessions (as pdfs?)
  I am thinking of letting Google AI studio build the front-end but we will need to give it specs, come up with interface between our bench and and front-end, think of scheduling etc. Initially I can run it
  manually on VPS to test interest...
  What do you think?


• That’s exciting news—once Claude’s refactor lands I’ll stay hands-off until it’s merged. Meanwhile, here’s how we could approach the “AI round‑table reality show” idea:

  Flow & Scheduling

  - Maintain a session queue: topics submitted by viewers, each tagged with metadata (submitted_by, timestamp, votes, moderation status).
  - Automate a daily or twice-daily “run”:
      - Pull the highest‑ranked, moderated topics.
      - Spin up a bench session with predefined facilitator config and participating models.
      - Kick off the discussion, capture the transcript + bench troubleshooting pack.
      - Publish outputs (PDF/HTML archive, summary, watch link).
  Frontend/API handshake

  - Bench entry points:
      - Endpoint or CLI to start a session with a topic payload (title, prompt, participant list).
  - Frontend features:
      - Submission form with basic moderation filters (language, length, prohibited terms).
      - Voting interface (simple upvote or ranking UI).
      - Upcoming session schedule with countdown.
      - Live viewer mode (embedded bench viewer or curated stream).
      - Archive page listing past sessions with download links (PDFs, raw logs, summary).
  - Queue API between frontend and bench:
      - POST /topics with submissions (returns moderation status).
      - GET /topics/pending for bench scheduler to fetch the next round.
      - POST /sessions to trigger or record results (topic_id, participants, artifacts location).
      - GET /sessions/active for the frontend to display live sessions.

  Moderation & Monitoring

  - Lightweight automated filters (regex/profanity, length, duplicates).
  - Optional human review step before pushing a topic into the “ready” pool.
  - Metrics logging (votes, participation, viewer counts) for later iteration.

  Deployment approach

      - Cron or serverless job to schedule sessions.
      - Background worker to convert transcripts to PDF, upload to a storage bucket, update archive metadata.

  Data storage

  - Simple Postgres or SQLite for topics, votes, session records.
  - Object storage (S3/GCS) for transcripts, packs, PDFs.
  - Keep timestamps/timezone info since sessions are scheduled.

  - Clear API contract (request/response json).
  - UI mockups (topic submit, voting board, live session view, archive).
  - Expected flows (submit → moderation → voting → scheduled run → archive).
  - Authentication needs (maybe simple click-through to start, later add auth).

  Once Claude finishes the refactor we can harden the backend endpoints and start drafting that spec. Let me know when you have details from Claude’s side, and we’ll slot the next steps.


› In our current "wrapper" approach AI participants will be CLIs (or Ollama hosted OSS models) with system prompts/instructions  - will it limit severely ability to discuss non-code related topics? Could we for
  every topic prepare some docs content for AIs to review to make discussions more engaging?


• I'm exploring how wrapper approaches might restrict CLIs mostly to coding tasks, but we can supply context through files, summaries, or topical packets—maybe using vector stores or prep pipelines to convert
  PDFs to text. I’m thinking about balancing token limits, embedding context, and multi-turn retrieval while also suggesting ways to attach and display reference materials alongside sessions.

─ Worked for 11s ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• The wrapper approach doesn’t lock us into code-only conversations—it just means each participant is a command‑line client with a “system prompt” and whatever files we put in its working directory. If we want
  them to have richer, non-technical discussions we can give them better context:

  - Topic briefs: Before each round table, generate a “topic dossier” (summary, facts, links, related history) and drop it into the session folder so every CLI can read it.
  - Context files: Include curated articles, PDFs converted to text, or previous session notes. Each wrapper can be instructed to consult those files before speaking.
  - General-purpose models: Instead of using code-focused CLIs (like claude-code), spin up conversational wrappers (OpenAI gpt-4o-mini, Google gemini-1.5-flash, or OSS models via Ollama) with prompts tailored to
    the theme.
  - Retrieval hooks: Wire a lightweight retrieval tool (e.g., rg against the dossier) so participants can cite evidence during the discussion.
  - Pre-session prep: Use a pipeline to scrape viewer-submitted sources or produce a quick briefing from trusted references, then package it as part of the session artifacts.

  So the wrappers give us flexibility; the key is to package the right materials with each topic. That way the “reality show” discussions can range from culture and ethics to science or policy—just feed the
  participants a solid dossier and nudge them with the right instructions.


› Does CLI allow control temperature?


• Most of the CLI wrappers you’re using (Claude’s claude, OpenAI’s openai, Google’s gemini, Ollama, etc.) do expose generation parameters such as temperature—you just have to pass them when you launch the tool.

  - Claude CLI (claude): claude chat --model claude-3-opus --temperature 0.7 …
  - OpenAI CLI (openai api chat.completions.create …): include "temperature": 0.6 in the JSON payload.
  - Our wrappers: we can expose temperature as a command-line flag or env var when we invoke the model.

  So yes, the CLI layer doesn’t limit temperature control—you just need to pass the parameter through when starting each participant.


› How expensive would you think each round-table could be it terms of API costs or say RupPod time?


• I’m thinking about how to roughly estimate cost per participant in a round-table using GPT-4 or Claude, considering tokens, turns, and duration. I want to provide ballpark numbers for tokens generated and
  corresponding costs on different pricing models, plus mention local model costs on GPU rentals like RunPod. This could help the user get a general idea of computation expenses for a multi-participant chat.

─ Worked for 14s ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• It depends mainly on three things: number of participants, how many turns they take, and the model you pick.

  ### API Models (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini)

  Assume a round table with 3 participants, each taking 5 turns, and each message averaging 1,000 tokens in and out (so 10k total per participant per topic):

  | Model (May 2025 pricing) | Input cost / 1K tok | Output cost / 1K tok | Per participant (10k tok) | 3‑participant session |
  |--------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
  | GPT‑4o mini          | $0.00015            | $0.00060             | ≈ $0.0075                 | ≈ $0.0225             |
  | GPT‑4o               | $0.003              | $0.009               | ≈ $0.12                   | ≈ $0.36               |
  | Claude 3 Sonnet      | $0.003              | $0.015               | ≈ $0.18                   | ≈ $0.54               |
  | Claude 3 Opus        | $0.015              | $0.075               | ≈ $0.90                   | ≈ $2.70               |

  If a session runs longer or produces more tokens, scale costs linearly. Adding a fourth participant adds another ~⅓ to the total. Summaries/archives (extra completion calls) add modest overhead (usually cents
  at most).

  ### Running OSS Models (RunPod / VPS)

  If you host an open-source model (Llama 3, Gemma, etc.):

  - RunPod prices start near $0.40–$1.00/hour for consumer GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000). A 10-minute round table with one GPU is about $0.07–$0.17.
  - Multiple participants can share one GPU if they run sequentially; if you want true concurrency, allocate more VRAM or spin up separate pods.
  - You’ll also pay for storage/egress if you archive transcripts, but those costs are minor (pennies per session).

  ### Takeaways

  - A modest round table (3 participants, 5 turns each) on GPT‑4o mini is only a few cents. Even with GPT‑4o or Claude Sonnet it’s under a dollar.
  - OSS models on RunPod cost under twenty cents per session if you let the pod idle only during the round table.
  We can easily project more precise numbers once you pick models, message lengths, and session cadence.


› ... but contrary to debugging, just discussion does not take too much tokens, right? ... unless they discuss images or videos... Lets take as example expensive APIs like Claude to get upper estimate. How many
  turns? We could have different formats... Bainstormini type - pretty much endless If we target "reaching aggreement" that would be shorter... What do you think?


• Right—debugging tends to be token-heavy, but a conversational round table is usually leaner, especially if you steer the format.

  ### Rough Token Math

  Suppose you use Claude 3 Sonnet (mid-tier cost) and keep the conversation structured:

  - Participants: 3 panelists + 1 facilitator.
  - Turns per participant: ~5 (facilitator setup + 4 responses each).
  - Average length per message: 300 tokens input, 400 tokens output (so ~700 tokens combined, which is generous for a concise round-table reply).

  That’s ~3,500 tokens per participant, or ≈14K tokens total per session. Claude Sonnet rates ($0.003 in / $0.015 out per 1K tokens) yield:

  - Input: 14K × $0.003 = $0.042
  - Output: 14K × $0.015 = $0.21
  - Total ≈ $0.25 per session

  Even if you double it to allow longer remarks or an extra closing summary, you’re still well under $0.50 per round table. Claude 3 Opus would be about $1.25–$2.50 with those same numbers.

  ### Format Considerations

  - Multimedia (images/video): prompts and outputs spike quickly. If you stay text-only it’s almost negligible.

  ### Other Costs


  ### TL;DR

  Even with “expensive” models, a typical 30-minute panel with a few participants and concise turns is only a few dozen cents. Massive brainstorming marathons can climb toward $1–$3, but still manageable. The
  main knob is conversation length; aim for agreement/summary formats, and you’ll stay comfortably within budget.


› Would it be interesting to try to give AI's voices by text2speech?


• Giving each AI a voice could make the round tables feel much more like a “show,” and technically it’s very doable:

  Pros

  - Adds personality and presence—viewers can differentiate speakers without reading subtitles.
  - Makes recorded archives (audio or video) more engaging.
  - Let’s you vary tone: authoritative moderator vs. curious participant, etc.

  Cons

  - Adds latency: most high-quality TTS engines take an extra second or two per utterance.
  - Adds cost if you’re using paid APIs. (Azure/Polly are fractions of a cent per character; ElevenLabs is a bit higher.)
  - Requires an audio pipeline (mixing, streaming, storage). Transcripts become secondary.

  Implementation Sketch

  - After each AI message, run it through a TTS service (e.g., Azure Neural Voices, Amazon Polly, ElevenLabs). Queue the audio output alongside the text.

  Note on License/Branding

  - Some TTS providers have usage terms—be mindful, especially for public streams.

  Next Step

  - Once the text-only loop is solid, we can prototype TTS for one participant (or the moderator) to gauge reception and load. Logically this sits in the “post-processing” stage of the pipeline, so it won’t
    affect the discussions themselves.


› Could we test it (audio) out locally first in out bench/viewer before public?


• Ran python3 -m venv .tts-env
  └ (no output)

─ Worked for 17s ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Absolutely—you can prototype audio locally before anything goes public. Two simple options:

  ### 1. OSS TTS library (for a quick preview)

  Use a lightweight library like tts (coqui-ai) or pyttsx3:

  python3 -m venv .tts-env
  source .tts-env/bin/activate
  pip install TTS
  tts --text "Hello from ActCLI Bench." --out_path output.wav

  Then link that into the bench so each AI message also gets an output.wav. You can create a small “audio” tab in the viewer to play it.

  ### 2. Hook into the bench UI locally

  - Keep it offline: after each AI response, call the local TTS tool and save the audio next to the transcript.
  - Update your viewer to show a “play” button next to each turn that loads the .wav.
  - Iterate on voice selection/latency/volume in private. No external APIs required until you’re happy with the experience.

  Once you have the pipeline working locally, switching to a hosted TTS API (Azure, Polly, ElevenLabs) would just change the tool command—but you’ll already know exactly how it should behave. That’s a safe way
  to evaluate whether voices add the personality you’re after before you expose it in the public demo.


› Are there some more or less formal specs for roundtable formats, so that we could just load configuration and go in automatic fashion?


• There isn’t a single industry standard for “AI round-table” formats, but you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Many debate / panel / facilitation frameworks can be expressed as structured configurations.
  Here’s a pragmatic way to encode formats so your scheduler/bench can “load and go” with minimal manual work.

  ———

  ### 1. Define a Format Schema

  Treat each format as a bundle of instructions:

  High-level structure (YAML or JSON)

  id: consensus-round-table
  title: "Consensus Round Table"
  description: "Goal is to reach a single shared answer in ~5 rounds."
  participants:
    - role: "Facilitator"
      model: "claude-3-5-sonnet"
      system_prompt: >
        You moderate the conversation, keep it concise,
        and summarize after each round how close the panel is to agreement.
    - role: "Expert-A"
      model: "gpt-4o-mini"
      system_prompt: >
        You argue for the first idea.
    - role: "Expert-B"
      model: "gemini-1.5-flash"
      system_prompt: >
        You present alternative angles and highlight risks.
  rounds:
    total_rounds: 5
    max_tokens_per_message: 400
    turn_order: ["Facilitator", "Expert-A", "Expert-B", "Facilitator"]
    facilitator_checks:
      - round: 3
        action: summarize_progress
      - round: 5
        action: deliver_final_consensus
  victory_condition:
    type: "agreement"
    success_criteria: "Facilitator declares consensus at end."
  timeouts:
    thinking_pause: 2  # seconds to wait before sending next prompt
  logging:
    transcript: true
    audio_tts: false
  artifacts:
    generate_summary_pdf: true
    generate_fact_table: false

  Key fields to include:

  | Field                 | Purpose |
  |-----------------------|---------|
  | id, title, description | For reference and scheduling UI. |
  | participants        | Roles, model names, system prompts. Attach any model-specific parameters (temperature, max tokens). |
  | rounds              | Number of rounds, turn order per round, optional prompts per round. |
  | facilitator_checks  | Points where the facilitator must summarize, gather votes, or call for final consensus. |
  | victory_condition   | Finishing criteria (agreement, winning vote, exploration with no conclusion). |
  | timeouts            | Wait times, optional break length between rounds. |
  | logging/artifacts | What to capture (transcripts, TTS audio, snapshots). |

  ———

  ### 2. Prepare Topic-Specific Dossiers

  When your scheduler picks a topic, generate a “dossier package” to deliver context to all participants:

  topics/
    session_2025-10-21/
      format.yaml   # copy of the round-table format config
      topic.txt     # user-submitted question + briefing
      sources.json  # list of documents, links, or dumped excerpts
      scoring_rules.yaml  # optional rules (e.g., rubric for agreement)

  Update each participant’s system prompt or pre-message to point to these files (“Refer to topic.txt before speaking”).

  ———

  ### 3. Run Book (Scheduler Workflow)

  1. Load format config (e.g., consensus round-table).
  2. Create working session directory, copy dossier.
  3. Spawn bench session with participant wrappers + system prompts.
  4. Use API/scheduler to run turns according to rounds.turn_order.
  5. After each round, follow facilitator_checks.
  6. Once done, generate artifacts as flagged (transcripts, PDFs, audio, troubleshooting pack).
  7. Publish to viewer/archive.

  ———

  ### 4. Example Formats

  You can predefine multiple configs:

  1. Consensus Round Table – 5 rounds, aim for agreement.
  2. Open Brainstorm – 8 rounds, no conclusion required, free-form idea generation.
  3. Pro/Con Debate – each participant assigned sides, facilitator tallies votes.
  4. SWOT Analysis – 4 rounds (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
  5. Lightning Round – short 3-turn reactions for quick topics.

  Each format retains the same schema; only values change.

  ———

  ### 5. Future Extensions

  - Add audience_interaction fields (e.g., invite viewer questions in specific rounds).
  - Include pre_session_prompts triggered before the first turn (e.g., “Facilitator greet the audience”).
  - Hook into TTS by setting logging.audio_tts=true and injecting voice IDs per participant.
  - Add evaluation or scoring config to automatically grade a session or produce a scoreboard.

  ———

  With this configuration-driven approach, the bench just needs the loader and orchestrator; the same scheduler can run multiple formats with different structures, participants, and artifacts—all by swapping
  YAML configs.
