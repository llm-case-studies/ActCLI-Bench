# Screenshots Folder

Use this folder to drop screenshots for UI review and discussion.

What to put here
- PNG or JPG images of UIs, viewers, terminals, flows
- Short accompanying notes as needed (optional)

Recommended naming
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD__HHMM__feature-or-screen__platform.ext`
- Examples:
  - `2025-01-13__viewer__broadcast-live__linux.png`
  - `2025-01-13__ptk-shell__tabs-switching__macos.jpg`

Referencing in docs
- In Markdown: `![caption](docs/screenshots/your-file.png)`
- Keep paths relative so links work across environments

Optional subfolders (use if helpful)
- `flows/` – step-by-step flows
- `bugs/` – issues with annotations
- `ideas/` – mocks or proposals

If you want, I can generate an index file that auto-links new images.
